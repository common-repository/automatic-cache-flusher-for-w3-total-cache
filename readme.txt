This plugin flushes the W3 Total Cache after a plugin update.

== Description ==

W3 Total Cache recommends clearing your cache after a (plugin) update to prevent cache conflicts. Currently, there is no setting that does this automatically for you. W3 Total Cache shows a banner with a 'clear cache' button after an update, but you need to click it yourself. What a waste of precious mouse clicks. Also, the banner 'solution' is not practical if you use 3rd party software to update your plugins, such as Installatron or ManageWP.
